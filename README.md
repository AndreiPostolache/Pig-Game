# Pig-Game
This is the Pig Game project from Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course" on Udemy. The game is a simple dice game where two players take turns rolling dice and accumulating points. The goal is to reach a predetermined score before the other player. The project showcases my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
